# Portfolio website

This is my portfolio website I am currently working on. It uses the Svelte framework and Tailwind with DaisyUI for styling.

## Developing
To start developing the website run the following commands
```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.


## TODO:
- Add LinkedIn to socials
- Add about me section with images
- netlify contact form at the bottom?
